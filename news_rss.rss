Parnas, who is out on bond on federal campaign finance charges, also spoke publicly this week for the first time about his involvement in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josh Lederman, national political reporter for NBC News, explains what we learned from Parnas, the credibility of his allegations, and how this new information could influence the Senate trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a question about the Senate trial or something else impeachment-related?

Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The failures of liberal half measures, compromise and "third way" politics has opened the door for right-wing demagogues to take power. It has also re-awakened a militant and energized left to combat both the wackadoodle right and the tepid center. We're seeing this play out in American politics and the 2020 Democratic primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor is a scholar, author and activist. Her writing and speaking has incisively and ferociously exposed the failures of capitalism and the necessity of a fierce struggle to overcome it. She joins Michael to discuss how the hell we got here and how we liberate ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impeachment proceedings against President Trump has now reached the Senate and to help our viewers navigate the legal and political issues surrounding it, Peter Robinson sits down with the Hoover Institution’s Visiting Fellow John Yoo and Senior Fellow Richard Epstein, two of the foremost legal scholars in the country. We cover the Articles of Impeachment submitted by the U.S. House of Representatives, the pluses and minuses of calling witnesses, the role of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts in the proceeding, and whether or not President Trump should testify on his own behalf. Finally, Peter asks Epstein and Yoo for their vote predictions on conviction and acquittal and gets their predictions for the election in November.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>institutionhoover@gmail.com (Uncommon Knowledge)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">2fc972d4a51244f398f2b8e9ed8099cd</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/2fc972d4a51244f398f2b8e9ed8099cd/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 07:48:44 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>The Daily Bernie Podcast : CNN Slammed For Unfair Bernie Questions</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Daily Bernie podcast is a short-form podcast to give the daily news about Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign and related news about progressive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s episode we discuss these headlines: CNN Slammed for Unfair Debate Questions to Bernie; Trump Privately Obsessed with Bernie's Campaign; Bernie is in 1st place nationally in a new poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related links:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/viewers-trash-cnn-following-debate-085223390.html"&gt;Viewers trash CNN following debate for biased questions against Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/478340-cnn-moderator-criticized-for-question-to-sanders"&gt;CNN moderator criticized for question to Sanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-botched-democratic-debate_n_5e1e981bc5b63211760b0fad?guccounter=1"&gt;CNN Completely Botched The Democratic Presidential Debate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/sanders-warren-cnn-debate/"&gt;CNN Has It In for Bernie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/01/15/bernie-sanders-cnn-iowa-debate/"&gt;At the Iowa debate, Bernie Sanders’s most vociferous opponent was CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bernie-sanders-reaches-4-million-donations-thanks-in-part-to-automatic-monthly-giving/2019/11/20/5193d6ac-0ae2-11ea-bd9d-c628fd48b3a0_story.html"&gt;Bernie Sanders reaches 4 million donations, thanks in part to automatic monthly giving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-privately-obsessed-with-bernie-sanders-popularity-and-socialisms-appeal"&gt;Trump Privately Obsessed With Bernie Sanders’ Popularity and Socialism’s Appeal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/warren-biden-sanders-2020-poll-election-1482714"&gt;Bernie Sanders narrowly leads 2020 race as Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden slide in latest poll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-new-hampshire-democrats-poll-1482782"&gt;Bernie Sanders Leads All Democratic Candidates in New Hampshire, Poll Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support the podcast!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support the Daily Bernie podcast on Patreon: &lt;a href="http://patreon.com/dailyberniepod"&gt;http://patreon.com/dailyberniepod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Twitter: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TheDailyBernie"&gt;http://twitter.com/TheDailyBernie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Facebook: &lt;a href="http://facebook.com/dailyberniepod"&gt;http://facebook.com/dailyberniepod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Instagram: &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/dailyberniepod"&gt;http://instagram.com/dailyberniepod&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Website: &lt;a href="http://www.dailyberniepod.com/"&gt;http://www.dailyberniepod.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find our podcast on &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily-bernie-podcast/id1493033686?uo=4"&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0kh8ZxeLAgW1y6tjWx5mlS"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, and other podcast apps!

Could the far north (or a portion of it) follow a path like Antarctica, and become a zone in which countries agree that scientific collaboration is the top priority? Or are we doomed to a future of territorial competition as the sea ice melts? This gets into the possibility of military conflict but doesn’t put it quite so much in the center of the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We also talk about development versus conservation: The Arctic is home to some amazing wildlife and as-yet undamaged ecosystems. But as people in Montana sometimes say, “you can’t eat the view.” Meaning, preservation of wildlife and wild places can in some cases make it hard for local people to earn a living. As industries move north the tension between economic development and conservation of land, water, air and creatures is increasing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In this final episode for the first season we talk about future Arctic Dreams - and Nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Introduction by Anna Kireeva from Russia&lt;br&gt;Tim Andersson from Sweden&lt;br&gt;Thomas Nilsen from Norway&lt;/p&gt;

He presented his vision of ambitious progress for America. The editorial board challenged him to detail how that vision would be executed, especially given his age, his lukewarm record on bipartisan achievements and the deeply polarized state of the nation.

Ayanna Pressley on alopecia, her struggle with hair loss</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Rep. Ayanna Pressley revealing her struggle with alopecia is helping to break down the stigma surrounding hair loss, while inspiring countless people across America. Rep. Pressley joins Joy Reid on this special edition of Who Won the Week, telling Joy Reid, ‘Hair is political. So far as who won the week it's the millions... that are living daily with the trauma and stigma of hair loss.’ Pressley also discusses Elizabeth Warren, the 2020 presidential race, whether it’s important to have a woman president, identity politics, and more. AND: The Donald Trump impeachment trial in the Senate is discussed by Rep. Terri Sewell who tells Joy Reid, ‘We need to put the pressure where the pressure deserves to be, on Mitch McConnell and the senators.’ PLUS: Ukraine scandal-related documents show that Lev Parnas engaged in conversations with a Devin Nunes staffer regarding the Ukraine aid. Former Republican member of Congress Carlos Curbelo joins Joy Reid to discuss Parnas and the state of the GOP telling AM JOY, ‘I find Lev Parnas credible.’ THEN: Donald Trump has a high approval rating among Republicans, but there are many prominent members of the GOP who want the president to be defeated in the 2020 election, even if that means electing a Democrat. Republican media strategist Rick Wilson, author of ‘Running Against the Devil: A Plot to Save America from Trump--and Democrats from Themselves,’ joins Joy Reid to discuss saying, ‘You don't have to crush Donald Trump by 5 million votes... You need to crush him by 271 electoral votes.’ All this and much more in this Sunday edition of AM JOY on MSNBC.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>nbcnews.podcasts@gmail.com (AM Joy)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">9d5cd3e2cf474c70a199a8f9dc4af6fe</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/9d5cd3e2cf474c70a199a8f9dc4af6fe/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2020 11:44:24 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Bannon's War Room : Ep 122: Invalid on its Face - Impeachment Articles w/Cynthia Lummis, David Rivkin, and Jim Schultz</title><description>Steve Bannon is joined by Cynthia Lummis, candidate for U.S. Senate from Wyoming, renowned constitutional lawyer David Rivkin, and Associate White House Counsel Jim Schultz to discuss the the invalid nature of the articles of impeachment House Democrats have sent to the Senate for the "trial of the century".</description><author>admin@citizensoftheamericanrepublic.org (Bannon's War Room)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">fc53b4b21bab4f80b628c661cbca99a9</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/fc53b4b21bab4f80b628c661cbca99a9/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2020 07:44:05 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>The Political Mind of Jerry Brown : The Thrust</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Unlike his first time in the governor’s office, Jerry Brown uses ballot initiatives to create a forward-moving agenda; leading California off a fiscal cliff and enacting reforms on criminal justice and water.  And when Donald Trump wins the presidency, Brown rejects the label of the California “resistance” in favor of pushing ahead with progressive policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ondemand@kqed.org (The Political Mind of Jerry Brown)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">8a90864ba38a493b949277afdf86bdc1</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/8a90864ba38a493b949277afdf86bdc1/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2020 03:07:27 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>The Trending Stories Taking Over podcast | T.S.T.O. : 016 | RING hackers, Instagram police, Cheese graters, and MONEY</title><description>&lt;p&gt;It's time for ANOTHER episode of the TSTO show because those trending stories just won't stop taking over! &amp;nbsp;This week we discuss the latest RING hackers, Instagram police, Cheese graters, and MONEY! &amp;nbsp;You won't want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

The Department of Defense, led by Secretary Mark Esper since 2019, has a budget of $738 billion this year. And while many of those dollars pay for those who serve in the armed forces and the maintenance of a nuclear arsenal, a significant portion of that budget will go to the military-industrial complex, which President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned Americans about in his farewell address in 1961, and which, prior to his appointment, Secretary Esper represented in Washington as a lobbyist. With the question of war in the air after the United States--in a targeted drone strike on Iraqi soil approved by President Donald Trump--assassinated the second most powerful man in Iran, Qasem Soleimani, who stands to profit? On this episode of Who Is, Sean Morrow dives deep into Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and the military-industrial complex.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

But first, a bit about how this podcast came about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A few years ago, I found myself in a sun-lit conference room full of policy makers, academics, and social justice advocates talking about what a guaranteed income policy might look like. After more than two decades doing intersectional social justice work, much of it advocating for giving cash directly to people who experience economic injustice, I was excited by the conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This wasn’t the first time I’d heard about guaranteed income. You’ve probably heard about it by now, too—everyone from Silicon Valley titans to presidential hopefuls are talking about guaranteed income (also called universal basic income) as a way to deal with increasing automation and runaway inequality. I first heard about the concept in college in the mid-90s through the 1967 writings of Martin Luther King Jr. In the year before King was assassinated, he wrote “the time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty” by providing a basic level of material well-being to allow all Americans to truly flourish. To be honest, when I first read that, I thought it sounded ridiculous. Free money went against everything I'd learned about being a respectable citizen. But people change and our ideas evolve. I no longer think guaranteed income is absurd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When it comes to economic injustice in the United States, we have a well-established practice of talking &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; people who are poor but not listening to them. We try to solve the problem without talking to the people closest to it. As a result, we’ve created a lot of bad policy that treats poor people as a problem to solve instead of the holders of the solutions. (The &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; problem to solve is wealth hoarding.) Back at that conference a few years ago, I was thrilled about the genuine interest in implementing guaranteed income, with its underlying ethos of self-determination and trusting people to do what is best for them. But I was wary of any movement that didn’t include the voices and leadership of the people it was meant to support. So I brought up this critical omission. Instead of being challenged, as I often am, heads were nodding, and I was asked to do something about it. So I did. This podcast is the result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I reached out to activists, advocates, and service providers across the country to set up workshops with groups of people who are living at the shit end of all our collective money distribution problem. I went to six cities—from Jackson, Mississippi, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Los Angeles, California, and heard from more than 100 people. I did a dozen phone interviews with advocates like Ai-Jen Poo of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Aisha Nyandoro of the Magnolia Mother’s Trust, and Anand Giridharadas, writer of &lt;em&gt;Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The stories were overwhelmingly powerful—partly because of how unnecessarily traumatic and difficult economic injustice has made people’s lives, but also because of how innovative, determined, and collaborative people are when it comes to surviving and imagining a better future for themselves, their families, and their communities. When it came to the idea of guaranteed income, what I heard was an overwhelming “yes.” There was a wide range of things people said about the difference it would make in their lives, and none of it was surprising. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A woman in Jackson said she’d go on vacation for the first time in 10 years. That vacation would be driving with her kids two states over to Georgia to visit family her children had never met. A mother from LA said she’d pay the legal fees necessary to help her parents emigrate to the US. A young man from San Francisco would help his sisters out with diapers and clothes for his nieces and nephews. People talked about paying off debt, going back to school, working less so they could spend more time with their kids, caring for aging parents, saving for a house, buying a car, starting businesses, and taking their family to Disney World. It was all of the regular things people do when they don’t have to worry so much about money. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As I was having these conversations, I was also talking about guaranteed income to a lot of audiences at conferences and seminars (this is what happens when you become one of, like, four Black people publicly talking about guaranteed income). Most of these audiences were liberal or progressive. And I was struck by the two main concerns that often came up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first is best summed up as, “But, how can we pay for it?” That’s not really the question people are asking though. We are the wealthiest nation in the world. The question isn’t, can we pay for it? But, do we want to? This question is really about who we fundamentally want to be as a nation. Do we want to ensure that everyone has access to the basic human rights that cash can enable? Or do we want to continue to be a country where people are saddled with medical and education debt, working multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, and living on the street because the rents to damn high?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The second question was, “But what about X other important super thing (like education or health care)?” And I kept thinking, Why do we think we have to choose? People on the left keep behaving as if we are sitting at someone else’s table. And we compromise before we even get there. I get it, there are so many pieces that need to come together to get us to the future we actually want and every one will require a fight. But I think we need to demand more, not less. I’m so pleased to see candidates like Warren, Sanders, and Castro, when he was still in the race advocating for multiple bold policies. We deserve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of it! (Yes, the candidate who is actually talking about guaranteed income, Andrew Yang, is missing from my list. This is because his plan would gut welfare benefits and I think that’s a non-starter for any genuinely progressive guaranteed income proposal. As you’ll hear in the podcast, there are strange bedfellows in the guaranteed income world.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Guaranteed income isn’t a silver bullet (and let’s stop looking for silver bullets, because there are none). But I think it's a policy worth exploring. Perhaps even more importantly, it invites us to have a long overdue conversation about deservedness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Capitalism conspires with racism and sexism to tell us that personhood is earned through paid labor. It tells us that our humanity is conditional. It saw we have to prove ourselves worthy of basic human rights like shelter, food, education, and healthcare. It has us taking pride in working later and not getting enough sleep because demonstrating “productivity” is one of its highest virtues. We believe that hard work equals success. We accept the idea that people who aren’t successful must not be working hard enough. If they are not working hard enough they are not proving that they are deserving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's utter nonsense that people who are poor are not working hard—in the podcast you’ll hear from people working multiple jobs, people working exhausting shifts, all just to keep food on the table for themselves and their families . But that’s not even the point. The point is, we do not have to earn our human rights. A total slacker is just as deserving of a roof over their head, food in their bellies, and access to schools and healthcare. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We need a new story of what America is that tells us this: Our worthiness, our value as human beings, is intrinsic to our very existence. It’s not something we have to earn and not something we can un-earn. We need a story that says success is a collective endeavor, that connection and care are the values we should use to measure our achievements. We need a story that starts with the assertion that there is more than enough for all of us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
