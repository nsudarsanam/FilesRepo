Robert MacFarlane (Jason Plays Favorites #7) – deep time rising</title><description>&lt;p&gt;[From February through March 22, 2020 (his last day hosting Think Again) Jason will be revisiting favorite past episodes. Jason's new show, starting May 12th, is &lt;a href="https://radiopublic.com/clever-creature-with-jason-gots-6L0pKq"&gt;Clever Creature with Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m underground as I write this, one day before taping the conversation you’re about to hear, speeding through New York City subway tunnels that aren’t all that ancient but whose darkness, and rats, and crumbling, esoteric infrastructure holds fear and fascination enough for anyone who contemplates them. Waking up this morning—notice how you wake up, not down—I felt my already barely remembered dreams sliding off of me in layers, like leaves, or hands. And the longing to submit to those hands and slide back down, underground, into the caverns of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guest today, &lt;a href="https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/robert-macfarlane"&gt;Robert MacFarlane&lt;/a&gt;, has dug deeper than I could ever hope to into the meanings and magnetism of the underworld —tunnels, caves, sinkholes, and the living, fungal earth of our world and our imaginations. At one point in his new book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Underland-Deep-Journey-Robert-Macfarlane/dp/0393242145"&gt;UNDERLAND&lt;/a&gt; he brings up the fact that to a neutrino, our solid physical world is just a a mesh—Mount Everest is a wide-gauge net it can pass easily through. In MacFarlane’s writing, the layers of the world are transparent, overlapping, always already present. He’s often called a “nature writer”, but that’s a poor proxy for what he actually is: a philosopher poet with the gift of sight in the darkness, whose penetrating vision turns the world inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starters in this episode: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/videos/eo-wilson-on-the-world-of-pheromones"&gt;E.O.

These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  NO HANDSHAKING! - fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Use only your knuckle for light switches, elevator buttons, etc. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Open doors with your closed first or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and commercial doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been. Rub your hands vigorously - friction has shown to be as effective as soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain an infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread in the US:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Latex nitrate disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gas pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you. But all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected faces are directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs). The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth. (We touch our nose/mouth 90x/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus from a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrate gloves and the right sizes for your family. The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus and most other viruses from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel any “cold-like” symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available. I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful in this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all of us!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- James Robb, MD FCAP&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>michael@peakmind.org (Peak Mind with Michael Trainer)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">6c56438bc12649c9bafab8b6752a5903</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/6c56438bc12649c9bafab8b6752a5903/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 12:27:27 -0700</pubDate></item><item><title>Dear Sugars : Dear Sugars Presents: Family Ghosts</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Sugars wants to tell you about another great podcast: Family Ghosts, a show where people tell stories about experiences that transform their understanding of familial legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

The gift of suffering is that it illuminates humanity in a unique and special way. Although no one can truly understand the full suffering of another, or the impact of that suffering, they can accept our journey, stand with us, and learn to hold space for our process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In part three of this series we dive into Justin’s perspective and how he learned to stay healthy while loving someone in a rough spot. He shares how he knew Abi would be sick when he met her, yet chose to marry her knowing that it would affect his life. He talks about his own season of physical pain and sickness and how that paved the way for a greater measure of empathy and sacrificial love for Abi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Along with all of that, Justin and Abi discuss how to extract the gifts from within suffering, why we need more than one supportive source, how to take care of our own heart when someone we love is suffering, and letting go of over-responsibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Get ready to break co-dependency and have your view of suffering radically changed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;And don't forget to check out &lt;a href= "http://www.stumvollconsulting.com/courses/thecompassionproject"&gt; www.stumvollconsulting.com/courses/thecompassionproject&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on The Compassion Project!&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>lfa@stumvollconsulting.com (The Connected Life)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">b150196f2aca4ee68965d2cfa420a905</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/b150196f2aca4ee68965d2cfa420a905/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:01:00 -0700</pubDate></item><item><title>Manifest with Tori DeSimone : Title: Manifest with my Best Friend, Lindsay Margiotti | Flight Anxiety, Boys, Bad Driving, &amp; More</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys!

For me, therapy always seemed like something you'd only seek out if you were dealing with a lot of physical or emotional trauma, depression or anxiety. I didn't think I had any justifiable reason to go. I was comparing my pain with the pain of others, and mine never seemed significant enough against theirs. In today's episode I talk you through my entire process - from my assumptions about therapy; what led me to start considering it as a valid option; making my first appointment; what the experience was like and best of all, some of the amazing life-changing lessons I've learnt so far.

&lt;p&gt;Our lives can seem so overwhelming, and oftentimes, the more choices that we have, the more stress that we feel. Today we’re going to take a step back and look at how making little changes can give you BIG results! To help us along the way, is my friend Courtney Carver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever ask yourself, “How can I make things easier in my life?, How can I eliminate the feelings of stress and overwhelm?” In today’s world where we’re bombarded with new things every day and change is a constant, feeling stress has become our new normal and how many people feel all day long. We may not even recognize that it is happening, or maybe we just accept it as part of the “life package”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to examine how having “too much” might be unknowingly causing you this anxiety and what steps we can take to get rid of the excess and let go! Courtney’s blog, Be More with Less, shares so many wonderful ideas to simplify your life and her new book, Project 333: The Minimalist Fashion Challenge That Proves Less Really is So Much More, will challenge you to change your closet and your life! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Most of us recognize that friendships play an important role in our lives. Yet few of us realize how crucial they are for our health and well-being. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this interview, &lt;a href="https://lydiadenworth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Lydia Denworth&lt;/a&gt;, author of the book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Friendship-Evolution-Biology-Extraordinary-Fundamental/dp/0393651541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Friendship: The Evolution, Biology, and Extraordinary Power of Life's Fundamental Bond&lt;/a&gt;, shares fascinating research on the science of friendship. She argues that, "Friendship is as important as diet and exercise for both our psychological and physical health."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In our conversation, Lydia explains ways of assessing whether our friendships are healthy. She also describes the neuroscience of friendship. For example, she discusses a remarkable study where researchers looked at participants' brain patterns while watching snippets of different videos. Their analysis yielded a surprising finding, as Lydia explains, "Just by looking at the brain processing, they could predict who was friends with who."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
