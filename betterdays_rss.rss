They also give some really good advice on leadership, including the example of Wartime General vs Peacetime General, and leading a team that's zagging when everyone else in the field is still zigging. You're NOT gonna want to miss this one!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find Ben Horowitz's books as well as other incredible content &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/author/ben-horowitz/"&gt;at his website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave's first-ever book, Get Out Of Your Own Way, is coming this March!

From an early age we are told to “suck it up” and to “stop crying” and are not given permission to lean into the natural emotions that we feel. As a result, when we are adults we often see being “sensitive” as a negative thing without seeing it as the GIFT it really is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week I had the honor of connecting with therapist and coach for Highly Sensitive People, &lt;a href= "https://patriciayounglcsw.com/"&gt;Patricia Young&lt;/a&gt;. Patricia shares with us why being a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) is something we should see as a “super power” and why we should unapologetically OWN who we are .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patricia shares with us her personal story, and how she came to the conclusion that she was called to work specifically with Highly Sensitive People. She educates about the trait of High Sensitivity as well as the strengths of Highly Sensitive People; how to navigate relationships as a Highly Sensitive Person, and how to recognize and validate our needs as HSPs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope this episode encourages you no matter who you are, or what type of personality you have to be proud of it. We should never apologize or be ashamed of our feelings, and if you are someone that feels more deeply than those around you, that is actually a beautiful thing. As Patricia says, “We need you!”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After listening to this episode, connect with us in our private Facebook community, &lt;a href= "https://www.facebook.com/groups/2079694042156503/"&gt;Hope to Recharge&lt;/a&gt; and let us know what you think, because as always together is better!.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Connect with Patricia: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Website: &lt;a href= "https://patriciayounglcsw.com/"&gt;https://unapologeticallysensitive.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unapologetically Sensitive Podcast: &lt;a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/unapologetically-sensitive/id1440433481"&gt; https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/unapologetically-sensitive/id1440433481&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today's episode of Hope to Recharge is sponsored by &lt;a href= "http://betterhelp.com/hopetorecharge"&gt;https://Betterhelp.com/hopetorecharge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Betterhelp.com is the world’s leading provider of online therapy.

&lt;br /&gt;
It's a rare week that goes by without someone talking about the power, and the perils, of artificial intelligence. But if you're not an expert in machine learning, how do you separate fact from fiction? That's where Janelle Shane's expertise comes in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Janelle is the author of the book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Look-Like-Thing-Love/dp/0316525243/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=janelle+shane&amp;amp;qid=1579538715&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;You Look Like a Thing and I Love You: How Artificial Intelligence Works and Why It's Making the World a Weirder Place&lt;/a&gt;. As she describes how an AI learns, she reveals the gap between what researchers strive to do and what's currently possible. Janelle explains, "The AI in science fiction is almost exclusively this kind of human level, general AI, that's really smart, at least as smart as a human, and then the stuff we have in the real world is a lot simpler."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Janelle runs amusing AI experiments, in order to learn how machine learning works and where its limits begin. She shares stories of what happened when she trained AIs to tell knock-knock jokes, invent new recipes, and write pick-up lines. Along the way, she describes the ups and the downs of working with AIs to solve problems: "The pro is you might get an answer that you didn't expect. The con is also that you might get an answer that you didn't expect."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Janelle's work has appeared in publications like The New York Times, Slate, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and many more. In addition, she keeps readers up to date on recent projects and AI hilarity on her website, aiweirdness.com.&lt;br /&gt;

The friend confided she felt like a bad mom because she had no time to make her kids healthy meals.  That gave Shazi her initial idea: why not make organic pureed baby food, and sell it frozen instead of jarred? People told her she was crazy to take on Gerber, but she convinced dozens of friends and family to invest in Happy Baby. 15 years later, the brand is known as Happy Family Organics and reportedly makes more than $250 million a year.

Has been in the healing profession in one form or another since the age of 16 where she worked on a crisis line for teens. Christine spent the first part of her career in the front lines working at local sexual assault centres, long term therapeutic setting and shelters for domestic violence survivors. Since 2011, Christine has worked in her own private practice, which specializes in complex trauma and dissociative disorders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christine has over thirty years of working with individuals with Trauma, Post Traumatic Stress Disorders, Traumatic Dissociation, Developmental Trauma and Dissociative Disorders, with specialized training in EMDR, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Psychotherapeutic Meditation techniques, Neurofeedback and Havening. Christine is also the current clinical supervisor for WayPoints, a center in Fort McMurry, Alberta that specializes in sexual assault and domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christine teaches locally and at an international level on the issue of dissociation, complex trauma, and the intersection of dissociation and mindfulness. Christine is the current President for the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation. Christine has also served on the board of the ISSTD since 2010 and was the ISSTD treasurer from 2011-2017. She is the author of Dissociation, Mindfulness and Creative Meditations: Trauma informed practices to facilitate growth (Routledge, 2017). As well as avidly working with those who have been hurt the most, Christine has dedicated her professional life to educating others on the logic, normality and commonality of dissociation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The summation of her work is to educate practitioners about the vital importance of their presence, patients and care with those who have been through the most severe and brutal injuries so that they get treated with dignity and compassion. The four qualities of presence, patience, dignity and compassion applied to every aspect of the therapeutic process can result in profound inner healing; something every human deserves to experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Resources&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= "https://www.isst-d.org/"&gt;https://www.isst-d.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leave me a message via Speakpipe by going to &lt;a href= "https://therapychatpodcast.com"&gt;https://therapychatpodcast.com&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on the green Speakpipe button.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening to Therapy Chat!

That could be letting go of a business that you love or pretty much anything that you're passionate about. On today’s show, Brendan Meyers talks about this sensitive matter and gives an example of something that's going on in his life that he’s letting go of – a toxic relationship. 2020 is a new year with new opportunities. Take a look inside and ask yourself what you need to let go of so you can take hold of and focus on new things that truly serve you.&lt;br /&gt;

She creates experiences through her international retreats and workshops, empowering women to live from what she calls their “Brave Soul Place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her career began as a professional musician when she was 15, working as a songwriter, pianist, and vocalist in solo performance as well as with many other talented artists, but when she was 27 hit a health bump that dramatically shifted her life. After a parade of misdiagnoses, gaining 100 pounds in a year and becoming so ill that she could barely get out of bed, the doctors told her to get her affairs in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stacey began pursuing her health from a deeply spiritual angle that led her to shine a flashlight down all the corridors of her life: Thoughts, Beliefs, Patterns, Relationships, Spiritual Practices, Self-Care, Food, and Exercise. Through that experience and years of research of a diagnosis with Hashimoto’s (an autoimmune condition that affects the thyroid and therefore every cell in your body) she has been able to speak all over the US and reach people all over the world with her healing insights that she discovered through her own sacred journey. Stacey resides in Southern California with her author, tech-geek, musician husband and their two amazing, curly-haired teenage sons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In This Episode, You Will Learn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What drives judginess within each of us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The difference between being in relationship &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; someone and &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; someone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happens to our vision when we become judgy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to release judgment and become 100% committed to the whole person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with Stacey Robbins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.staceyrobbins.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.staceyrobbins.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.staceyrobbinscoaching.com/100-day-experience" rel="nofollow"&gt;100 Day Gong Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/staceyrobbins/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/staceyrobbins" rel="nofollow"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lovestaceyrobbins/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://staceyrobbins.com/coaching/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Coaching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://staceyrobbins.com/retreats-travel/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Women&amp;#39;s Retreats to Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://staceyrobbins.com/hashimotos/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Hashimoto&amp;#39;s Mind Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Miss A Single Episode:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-rising/id1448649388" rel="nofollow"&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Iqrp5q3bagph2t23malprd3dxvy?t=Launch_Yourself_Today" rel="nofollow"&gt;Google Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/42zIsXzjCibZt49xdCRvB4" rel="nofollow"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/in-plain-sight/launch-yourself-today" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stitcher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave a quick review&lt;/strong&gt; on any of the podcast apps to tell people what you think about the show.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a screenshot of the podcast&lt;/strong&gt; and post it on Instagram or Instagram Stories.

In this episode, Bhatia shares the primary health issues that she sees among her male patients—from low testosterone to other hormonal disruptions, imbalances in the gut, and nutritional deficiencies. She talks us through hormone replacement therapy—and why she thinks you need to be very careful—and which supplements she typically subscribes. She also talks about the warning signs that something is up—changes in energy, weight, libido—and why many men have a tendency to downplay what their body is telling them. For men and women, Bhatia believes that insulin resistance plays a huge role in many health conditions and that often the first step to healing or optimizing our health begins with dealing with insulin resistance and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more, see the &lt;a href="https://url.emailprotection.link/?bjE8wTftZfcmuju01p2ThIfpQqtnH14MhSdgHSujYuuTLx1Tb_Nj20EntNjGxHRdMOk_lzqS-bT4RkIbcm-K-yQ~~"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;goopfellas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast hub.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>podcast@goop.com (goopfellas )</author><guid isPermaLink="false">dbe4d67e52ab404f971d6f1001ded822</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/dbe4d67e52ab404f971d6f1001ded822/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Selfie : Creating Space to Feel Your Feelings + Sarah’s Last Episode | Selfie Podcast Episode 111</title><description>Sarah explains her decision to step back as host, and Kristen introduces the new show format and a new co-host.

I got goosebumps so many times and had to edit out my hundreds of "WOW" remarks (I couldn't help myself!). I really struggled to pick a title because nothing could succinctly summarise how interesting, engaging, informative, inspirational and truly unbelievable her story is. You've probably heard of The Quick Flick by now (winged eyeliner stamp for those who haven't), and maybe even her new venture Beauty Fridge. Iris Smit is only 24 and has managed to build a $15 million dollar empire in 2 years. From the outside, everything seemed perfect. Booming business; long term relationship; dream car; dream life, right? Despite every box being ticked, Iris was unhappier than she'd ever been. After experiencing horrific trauma as a child, she had no identity, no control, nothing to call her own and subsequently felt completely numb. It's the story of what came next that truly blew my mind in more ways than one. I won't spoil it because it deserves to be heard in context and in its entirety.

&lt;p&gt;Boundaries can be defined as the limits that we set around what we will or will not do, will or will not tolerate, and will or will not accept.  This is what we’re talking about in today’s episode, which is all about setting Boundaries for ourselves. Our guest today, the fabulous Nancy Levin, brings empowering insight that is relatable on so many levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a people pleaser? Do you bend over backward to make sure that everyone has everything they need, and let your own wants and needs fall by the wayside? How are you willing to step up for yourself? These are just some of the questions we’ll be discussing as we talk about how you can take time and energy back, freed up to inhabit your own lives and create space for what YOU truly desire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just remember that setting boundaries are between you and YOU…and just having this awareness will help you figure out where you’ve been sacrificing your own needs in life..in your career, your relationships and even your own well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
