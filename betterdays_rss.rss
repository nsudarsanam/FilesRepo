In the past, when I was expecting something, or excited about an upcoming event, I would be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; disappointed if it didn’t work out. It would actually affect my mood to a point where I would get into a very negative place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After practicing mindfulness, I slowly started to rewire my mind that when I now experience disappointment I can actually experience GRATITUDE in the midst of it. Why? Because I have seen that often when something doesn’t happen the way that I expected, it is actually a blessing in disguise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if I cannot see it in the moment, I know that there is something bigger at play that is making things move in my favor. I have had to learn how to trust God and know that all things are working out in my favor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again as we have talked about before when discussing gratitude, this is a muscle that we have to build and develop. Experiencing disappointment is hard. However often there is nothing we can do, so we have to ask ourselves how we can bring positivity into the situation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What about you? How do you handle disappointment? What from this episode will you start to practice and implement into your life? Let us know! We have a thriving Facebook community we would love to invite you to.

As they say, you can beat resistance at the gym or take command of resistance at work and everywhere, but when it comes to resistance in marriage, backing out is often the first thing that comes to mind. Dealing with resistance in marriage is what strengthens you and wiser. No one can brag that they have the perfect marriage, or they have never felt any resistance as a married couple. The strongest marriage has seen through thick and thin and has survived despite fierce resistance. If you're suffering from any form of resistance today, take time to analyze the situation, don't just walk away and give up. Only when two people meet will resistance be easier to resist.  &lt;/p&gt; -- Are you looking to connect with a group of like-minded habit hacking people?

They started dating, and Julia eventually quit her job and joined Kevin in the Bay Area. In 2006 they married, and co-founded the online ticketing service Eventbrite out of a warehouse closet. 14 years after launch, Eventbrite is a publicly-traded company with 1,100 employees and offices around the world.

&lt;br /&gt;
That's the question &lt;a href="https://www.jennyodell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Jenny Odell&lt;/a&gt; explores in her book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Nothing-Resisting-Attention/dp/1612197493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy&lt;/a&gt;. In it, she deftly draws on the work of artists, laborers, and writers, past and present, to discuss how others have grappled with this question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In attempting to clarify what she means by doing nothing, Jenny asks, "What's the difference between being allowed to be open...observant...reflective versus...constantly express[ing]...one's rage and anger...what if there's a part of you that deserves to remain unspoken, unarticulated in the moment?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this conversation, Jenny offers ways to resist the attention economy, but she's careful to avoid easy answers. Though she acknowledges how privilege gives some of us more options to resist than others, she emphasizes how all of us, privileged or not, operate within this productivity-obsessed system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fallout from our always-on culture is often exhaustion and anxiety, both of which Jenny sees in her students. She explains, "I can tell my students, 'Oh, just get better at time management.' That might help in some ways, but it's not going to help the...problem of this culture of productivity that was never humane to begin with."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jenny Odell is an artist, writer, and educator who teaches at Stanford University. She has been an artist-in-residence at the San Francisco dump, Facebook, the Internet Archive, and the San Francisco Planning Department, and she has exhibited her art all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;

Eve Ensler (Jason Plays Favorites #2) – no way out but through</title><description>&lt;p&gt;[From February through March 22, 2020 (his last day hosting Think Again) Jason will be revisiting favorite past episodes. Jason's new show, starting May 12th, is &lt;a href="https://radiopublic.com/clever-creature-with-jason-gots-6L0pKq"&gt;Clever Creature with Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;I feel I should let listeners know that this episode of Think Again is about surviving and thriving in the face of unspeakable trauma and sexual violence. And in order to get to the thriving, we have talk about the trauma, which may be painful for some listeners and inappropriate for kids. But I don’t want to scare anybody off—I think it’s one of the most valuable conversations we’ve ever had on the show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a human child growing up, trust is the foundation of everything. We learn how to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"&gt;regulate our emotions&lt;/a&gt;, how to see the world as relatively stable and safe through the connection with the people who care for us. Severely neglected children &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/02/20/280237833/orphans-lonely-beginnings-reveal-how-parents-shape-a-childs-brain"&gt;can suffer all kinds of harm&lt;/a&gt; to their ability to think, connect with others, and learn. But what happens when the caring bond is not only missing, but is horribly abused? Distorted through incest and sexual violence? How do you build a self and life after that? And let’s say you somehow manage to survive to adulthood…to thrive, even. How do you fill the place in your heart where the love and the trust is supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guest today has had to answer all these questions for herself. She is the playwright, author, and activist &lt;a href="https://www.eveensler.org/"&gt;Eve Ensler&lt;/a&gt;. You may know her as the creator of the Vagina Monlogues. What you might not know is that all the horrors I’m talking about happened to her as a kid. Let me take that out of the passive voice: her father did that to her, and more. And he died without saying anything remotely close to “I’m sorry”. So Eve wrote his apology for him—her book &lt;a href="http://smarturl.it/theapologybook"&gt;THE APOLOGY&lt;/a&gt; is a letter to her—to Eve—in the imagined voice of her dead father, retelling what happened, why it happened, and trying to figure out in these twisted circumstances what an apology would even mean…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starters in this episode: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/videos/great-risk-for-great-gain-immigrants-and-innovators-are-psychologically-the-same"&gt;Jared Diamond on immigrants and innovation &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts on relistening&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This episode with Eve Ensler means a lot to me. I came late to the feminist conversation about patriarchy and masculinity. About the ways men are taught to be ashamed of vulnerability, and how all that fear and shame can lead to violence. Listening back I’m struck again by this one thing she says: “Language changes everything. It’s like the word 'vagina'. If you can’t say it, you can’t see it. If you can’t see it, a lot of things can happen to it in the dark without your permission.” There is so much hope and power in the work Eve does to break the silence and encourage others to do the same. As a man, I hear it especially loud and clear when she says it’s time for men to “...make a choice. Whether they’re going to maintain allegiance to the male code or step into the next paradigm. Stopping the domination so they get to be free in this lifetime.” I hear it and I personally, enthusiastically accept that call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

Someone you know (or maybe even don't know) has done something to upset you or someone close to you, and so you talk about it. Maybe with one person, maybe with 10, maybe with more. You feel justified in doing so, because they did something wrong, right? You want that person to be held accountable, so you seek justice in the form of forming a group of people together who know how bad that person is and doesn't want to be friends with them anymore. You've won, because you've proven that you're innocent and they're guilty. Most of the time though, these things blow over. Everyone moves on and becomes friends again. Some feelings might have been hurt, but that's about it. Now, let's consider what happens when a YouTuber has a scandal. Tens of thousands (if not millions) of people join together to actively ruin someone's career. They want them to lose their jobs, their income, their stability, their friends, their support, their sanity and sometimes, when it gets bad enough, their lives. All for what? A bad makeup launch, a misconstrued tweet, befriending the wrong person or a mistake they made when they were a teenager, over 10 years ago? Internet culture has taken a turn for the worse, and someone needs to speak up about it.
