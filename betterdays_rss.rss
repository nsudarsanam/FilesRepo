In this episode of the Habit-Based Lifestyle Podcast, Jesse brings on a special guest Lance Greenberg. Lance is the founder of the Greenburg Media Group a company dedicated to turning website visitors and complete strangers into paying clients. He is here along with Jesse to talk about getting results. Have you gone through a rough patch in your life that forced you to overwork yourself? Did you ever stop and think there should be a limit regarding everything you do? Although hard work brings great results, take into consideration that there are other ways for you to achieve what you want without overdoing it. Strategic work and planning also gives you exceptional results and sometimes even more than what you planned. The key to getting what you want isn’t always about pushing yourself hard. Remember, it’s all about the strategy, the determination to succeed, and the courage to sit down and pray that you’re in alignment with what you’re supposed to do. &lt;/p&gt; -- Are you looking to connect with a group of like-minded habit hacking people?

When your world has stuck or sad energy, it needs gratitude to shift you into your highest self. In this episode, we go into gratitude, and Erica shares a message from Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna, as angels, where they communicate that no person is not worthy of being helped by an angel. No person is any less than any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just you being here on the planet means you are worthy. You are a spiritual being with a physical body. And you are loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, well, that's the show today!

I mentioned that I was starting this book back in episode six (&lt;a href= "https://hopetorecharge.com/episode/does-gratitude-lead-to-joy-or-does-joy-lead-to-gratitude-attitude-with-gratitude/"&gt;listen here&lt;/a&gt;) and that I would be returning to share with you what I learned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am almost done with the forty days and to be completely honest I had a difficult time for a while going through the practices. There is a heavy emphasis on feeling (and being grateful for) the negative experiences that we have. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although this is a great practice I did not feel right placing too much attention on the negative emotions that some of the practices encourage you to do.  I eventually had to stop these practices because they were not surviving me. I was however able to adjust it and enjoyed what I learned moving forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to share this with you because it is important for us to pay close attention to what works for us and what doesn’t. Just because something is in a book or a teaching, and may work for others does not mean that it will work for you. And that is okay! What is important is that you are turning inward and making decisions based on what feels right to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all I think this is a great book especially for those who are beginning their gratitude journey. I would love to hear YOUR thoughts about this book or what I shared with you today.

Listen in!</title><description>&lt;div&gt;My sleepwear business Lauren Curtis Lounge has been up and running since September 2018. It's my first business outside of YouTube, and while I knew it would be a challenging endeavour, I didn't realise just HOW challenging. Reece (my boyfriend and co-founder) and I have learnt SO. MANY. LESSONS. in the past year and a half (most of them the hard - and expensive - way), and so I wanted to share our experiences with you guys. Who knows, maybe you're thinking of starting a small business or perhaps you've already started and you just feel like you're in your head about where it's at and where you think it should be. Or, maybe it will make you feel better about mistakes that you've made that you're still beating yourself up about. Whatever the reason, I hope it helps you to realise that although I'm calling them mistakes for the sake of the podcast, I really don't consider them mistakes because we both learnt from them. That's what business is - trying something, seeing if it fails or succeeds, then learning from the failure or trying to prolong the success. Lauren Curtis Lounge is currently holding an up to 60% off Valentine's Day sale too, so if you'd like to try our brand now's the time!

&lt;br /&gt;
At some point, many of us have felt overlooked, underestimated, or even ignored in our work. We may have responded by putting our heads down and working that much harder, in the hope that someone would finally recognize our talents and skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet working harder can leave us feeling frustrated, especially when our efforts fail to change other people's perceptions. Harvard Business School Professor Laura Huang explains, "A lot of times, we think our hard work is going to speak for itself, but often we find that it doesn't. Even when we've proven ourselves and shown the ability to...provide value...we continue to have to guide the perceptions of others."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laura is author of the book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Turning-Adversity-into-Advantage/dp/0525540814/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5WQP6D0WSK80&amp;amp;keywords=edge+turning+adversity+into+advantage&amp;amp;qid=1580573055&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=edge+turning+%2Cstripbooks%2C199&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Edge: Turning Adversity into Advantage&lt;/a&gt;. In this interview, she explains why we need to shape how others see us. She asserts, "People are perceiving and making attributions...all the time. If you realize...somebody's making an incorrect attribution about you, changing that...is...difficult. It's more difficult than if you...direct [it] from the get go."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laura has been named one of the &lt;a href="https://poetsandquants.com/2016/04/13/2016-best-40-40-professors-laura-huang-wharton-school/?pq-category=business-school-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;40 Best Business School Professors Under the Age of 40&lt;/a&gt;. Her work has been featured in The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Nature.&lt;br /&gt;

So in 2011 she launched a line of clothing for working women that would be simple, elegant, and well-tailored. She had no experience in fashion but partnered with a top-line designer, Miyako Nakamura, to create M.M.LaFleur. Today it's a multi-million dollar company with loyal customers from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley.

Join me, as I talk with my friend, Yanik Silver, creator of the Cosmic Journal and founder of the Maverick1000, and learn how you can follow your Cosmic Alarm Clock and listen to your deepest self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanik has developed a charming and insightful journal experience that will help you evolve allowing you to really dig into what will give you joy in life.
