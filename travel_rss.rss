&lt;p&gt;#1- How Latinos embrace their incomplete education:&lt;/p&gt;
#2- Social media Latin style: you are what you post:
Latinos firmly believe that to get the absolute maximum “gringo wannabee” bragging rights they need to check 3 crucial things off their bucket list then post a thousand photos on the net.
 
(1) Visit Disney World, (2) Shop in Miami, (3) Stand in real snow
 
#3- Teaching English online from anywhere for 20+ bucks an hour:
The rules of the English teaching game are changing and today our resident expert Mr. B gives us the current dope
 
 #4- Once you arrive, its dead easy to getting a Job at an English Teaching Academy.. but look out, they will deceive you!
 
#5- When you arrive in Latin America you will be very busy but it will taper off:
Soon you will have an unusually large amount of time on your hands. Result being that you will need a hobby or two. Do you have one? If not, it could end up being booze and Cheetos
 
#6- Be sure to pick up my new and revised, "LATIN AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REPORT":
&lt;p&gt;The new edition for 2020 (and beyond) is available now, including the latest "Stem Cell" info and data and my top picks for the best treatment centers for expats and gringos.

&lt;p&gt;What makes this week&amp;#39;s installment of that series so special is that we have been joined by the author of the book himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M.J. DeMarco wrote The Millionaire Fastlane in 2010, and since then, the book has continued to grow in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic premise of the book is that the most successful people have found ways to step off of the &amp;quot;slow lane&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;sidewalk&amp;quot; to join the &amp;quot;fast lane&amp;quot;, usually through entrepreneurial endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M.J. joins us today to talk about the legacy of The Millionaire Fastlane, why it is still as relevant today as it was when it was released, his thoughts on the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>Dan@TropicalMBA.com (The Tropical MBA Podcast - Entrepreneurship, Travel, and Lifestyle)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">237d64fa6cf94579b0186fbcb60b08a2</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/237d64fa6cf94579b0186fbcb60b08a2/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 05:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>The Passenger with Hugh Acheson : The Basque, The Beer, And Built To Spill In Boise, Idaho</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Being that The Passenger is a travel show, one might expect us to highlight exotic, far-flung locales.

And that brings us to Boise, Idaho, an unlikely international city with a rich cultural life full of music, food, and the great outdoors.

Die traumhafte Inselgruppe an der australischen Ostküste hält viele "Wow-Momente" bereit. Mit dem Whitehaven Beach und den tollen Schnorchelgelegenheiten mussten wir die Chance nutzen ein weiteres Mal segeln zu gehen. Diesmal mit der Yacht "Blizzard" und dem tollen Skipperteam Brent und Sharon. Aller Erlebnisse von diesem dreitägigen Trip haben wir in dieser Episode zusammengefasst.

She is a qualified forest school practitioner, a busy mum, and a keen microadventurer. She works with urban groups who are "hard to reach", trying to help them get out into nature more. The biggest barriers aren't the actual dangers but people's fears about them. We are now as a society a generation removed from the free-range childhood we hear about nostalgically.

&lt;li&gt;Getting more out of life by getting outside more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getoutmorecic.co.uk/"&gt;Get Out More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with groups who are "hard to reach"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biggest barriers aren't the actual dangers but people's fears about them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking out the pockets of wildness - and they are always there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are part of nature and we are drawn to it, if we can find the key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green spaces are a neutral space for people to come together and connect together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started this because I wanted to get out more, but the success of it means that I now get out less...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't underestimate where people are to begin with - how little people might know at first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forest Schools - outdoor play in a learning environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We over-inflate how difficult things need to be sometimes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I'm being a good parent I am giving my kids the freedom I had as a child. That means facilitating but keeping hands off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are now as a society a generation removed from that free-range childhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contentment is more important than self-improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favourite purchase: Underwater MP3 player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nature and communities can grow healthier together&lt;/li&gt;

My husband and I are planning on a month in September in France to "live like locals".

We discuss that issue with Tom Ribe, executive director of Caldera Action, a nonprofit advocacy group in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we continue our series on how the health of the Colorado River impacts Canyonlands National Park and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Utah.

At a young age, she set a lofty goal for herself – to travel the entire world – and officially met her goal at just 35 years old. On today’s episode, Jessica shares stories from her experience as the first black woman to visit all 195 countries and document her journey along the way.

Mumbai With Vikram Chandra</title><description>“Mumbai may not be my city, but it is my kind of city.” Vikas Swarup, author of Q&amp;amp;A, adapted into the film, Slumdog Millionaire.&lt;br /&gt;
Mumbai is a fascinating city with diversity in religion and architecture, and in this interview, Vikram Chandra talks about the colonial impact of the Portuguese and British, as well as the Zoroastrian, Muslim, Hindu and Christian holy places in the city.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s also a feast for the senses, as Vikram evokes the taste of seafood from the harbor and the chaat street food on the beaches, the clang of ships in the dock, as well as the action spectacle of Bollywood films, and the multi-lingual speech of Hindi, Punjabi, English and Bombay slang. &lt;br /&gt;
We discuss how Vikram feels at home both in Mumbai where he grew up and in the Bay area, California, where he now lives and teaches, and he gives some book recommendations if you want to read more about the city.&lt;br /&gt;

Transcript of the interview&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna: Vikram Chandra is the multi-award-winning author of Red Earth and Pouring Rain, which won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for best first book as well as Love and Longing in Bombay and Sacred Games, adapted into a successful Netflix series set in Mumbai, which has just been listed on ‘The New York Times’ list of the 30 best international TV shows of the decade, which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome, Vikram.&lt;br /&gt;
Vikram: Hi. Pleasure to be here.&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna: I’ve been so excited about this because I love India so much.&lt;br /&gt;
Tell us a bit more about your multicultural background and your connection with the city.&lt;br /&gt;
Vikram: My father was a corporate executive, so we’d moved all over the countryside when I was a kid. And then when I was in 11th grade, we moved to the city and we’ve been there ever since.&lt;br /&gt;
I came to the United States in my second year of college and I’ve been going back and forth ever since. All of my work has to do with Bombay as you can tell from the titles of at least one of my books. And my immediate family and a lot of my friends are there.&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna: Fantastic. I haven’t been but I did want to ask you because it’s so interesting, I always say Mumbai because I thought that’s what we have to say now. But you use the term Bombay in your book title.&lt;br /&gt;
What is the cultural history of the name Mumbai/Bombay?&lt;br /&gt;
Vikram: There are various stories about how the city got its name. So there are texts written in the early 16th century which refers to the ci...</description><author>jo@booksandtravel.page (Books And Travel)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">1c51da112d804f69a21566dbd2cc7a2b</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/1c51da112d804f69a21566dbd2cc7a2b/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 16:10:35 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>San Francisco Real Estate: Escrow Out Loud : A Bridge (Loan) To Your Next Home</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s episode of &lt;a href="https://jacksonfuller.com/insight/podcast/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Escrow Out Loud, our San Francisco Real Estate podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; we are talking about bridge loans with our special guest from Opes Advisers, sales manager and senior loan advisor Tracy Andreini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[00:40] A lot of people think about selling their property at this time of year. The nice thing about bridge loans is that they make it possible for people to buy their next home allowing them to move out and stage their house for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[01:04] We have been working with Opes for over a decade now. Tracy tells us a little bit about Opes Advisers and her background. She also explains what a bridge loan is and what are some of its major benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[06:24] One feature of bridge loans is that they are short term loans, typically having a term of only six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[07:21] Another feature is that with a bridge loan there are no monthly payments. The only out of pocket costs are the 3% initial deposit and closing costs. Tracy explains how this works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[09:12] The interest rates on a bridge loan are time plus 2.5. Currently this would be 7.25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[10:18] What is the difference between a bridge loan and a regular equity line? Tracy goes over some issues with a HELOC that you don’t get with a bridge loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[13:32] If anyone has more questions or wishes to apply for a bridge loan Tracy recommends getting in touch with her on her cell-phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[14:00] Tracy talks about appraisals required for a bridge loan. What is different to the normal process that’s good to be aware of?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[15:38] As we learned earlier a bridge loan is a six month product and this is sufficient for a large majority of cases. But what happens when the six month period goes by and the house has still not sold? Are there extensions given?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[17:18] Most people are not aware of this product but it takes a lot of anxiety and pressure away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[18:38] Matt wraps up with a quick summary of points covered today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening.

The fair is designed to provide exposure to artists from the 54 countries that make up the continent. Touria talked about the changing landscape and dialogue surrounding African contemporary art since she began researching the idea for an African contemporary art fair about ten years ago. Touria launched the first 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair in in London in 2013 before travelling to New York in 2015 and finally to Marrakech in 2018. And today, the fair is one of the highlights of my social calendar each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With galleries openings, studio visits, talks and roundtables, and meetings with artists planned throughout the four-day event, the programme is rich!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen is as Touria talks about the fair, the contemporary art industry, and what visitors can expect during the third edition of the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair.&lt;/p&gt;

It became known for its lawlessness and unbridled violence during the 19th century.  Its history provokes scenes reminiscent of the Wild West.  All this, here in our own backyard.

Come hear the story of one Ohio Folklore listener who claims to have encountered a full-bodied apparition there, at Chidester Mill.  This replica of an original 1828 structure remains today, and is open to the public during the summer months.  It seems someone, however, stays all year round, guarding the place.

Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

You never know what you’ll encounter in these hills.

In a city that was forged in a crucible of earthquakes and fire, the 15-second message was a reminder to prepare for the worst — even if many residents ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2019, the city's &lt;a href="https://sfdem.org/tuesday-noon-siren"&gt;Department of Emergency Management&lt;/a&gt; announced that it was taking the system offline for two years to improve reliability and security in an overhaul that could cost as much as $2.5 million.&amp;nbsp;Now that the tradition has been interrupted, has the rhythm of city life lost a step? Also, who's likely to hear the Tuesday noon siren and what does it say about class and privilege?&lt;/p&gt;

It’s about the time a few years ago when I drove through Iran with my brother Drew and our friends Jane and Rosi as part of an &lt;a href="http://www.teamdonundestan.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;11,000 mile road trip we took&lt;/a&gt; across Europe and Asia, raising money for charity. Along the way, we had enlightening conversations with average Iranians that made us see their country in a totally new light.&lt;/p&gt;

Jeff is constantly traveling and developing new techniques for catching the most exotic fish imaginable in places where even the most avid adventurers are at times hesitant to go! As an active lecturer, published author, accomplished artist, IGFA World Record holder, and the subject of numerous films, articles, and media projects, Jeff is a fly fishing personality that is as entertaining and educational as he is legitimate. He is an incredibly reliable source of information and inspiration, the most senior member of the Yellow Dog Ambassador team, and a close friend. And while Jeff can boast one of the most impressive resumes around, he remains one of the most authentic and humble people in the industry – always willing to take his accomplishments one step further by passing on what he has learned.
