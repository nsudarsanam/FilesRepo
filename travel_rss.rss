His book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/976640688X/?tag=newbooinhis-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marcus Garvey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; documents the forging of Garvey’s remarkable vision of pan-Africanism and highlights his organizational skills in framing a response to the radical global popular upsurge following the First World War (1914–1918). Central to Garvey’s response was the development of organizations under the umbrella of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, which garnered the transnational support of several million members and sympathizers and challenged white supremacist practices and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garvey established the ideological pillars of twentieth century pan-Africanism in promoting self-determination and self-reliance for Africa’s independence. Although Garvey travelled widely and lived abroad in New York and London, he spent his early years in Jamaica. Rupert Lewis traces how Garvey’s Jamaican formation shaped his life and thought and how he combated the British colonial authorities as well as fought deep-rooted self-doubt and self-rejection among Jamaican black people. Garvey’s much neglected political and cultural work at the local level is discussed as part of his project to stimulate self-determination in Africa and its diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kirk Meighoo is a TV and podcast host, former university lecturer, author and former Senator in Trinidad and Tobago.

Fastpass vs MaxPass! Two very similar systems to avoid the lines at Disneyland, but one is free and one is an additional charge. Find out the similarities, and which one may be right for you in this episode of the Disneyland with Kids Podcast.&lt;/p&gt; In This Episode - Fastpass and MaxPass at Disneyland: &lt;p&gt;Becca from &lt;a href= "https://thiscrazyadventurecalledlife.com"&gt;This Crazy Adventure Called Life&lt;/a&gt; and Leslie from &lt;a href= "https://tripswithtykes.com"&gt;Trips with Tykes&lt;/a&gt; have been waiting for this epsiode. Which one is better, Fastpass or MaxPass? The answer depends. We may have also had to bring in someone to moderate this debate to make sure we stuck to the facts and didn't get passionate about our personal bias towards each system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we get into the show notes... Disneyland increased the price of MaxPass (and tickets) just days after we recorded, and the day before this episode went live. So it is important to note that ticket prices and MaxPass prices can change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are listening before February 20, 2020, you can still lock in the old prices of both MaxPass and Disneyland tickets through our partner at &lt;a href= "https://www.getawaytoday.com/?referrerid=7526"&gt;Get Away Today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this episode we cover:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What is the &lt;a href= "https://thiscrazyadventurecalledlife.com/disneylands-fastpass-maxpass-compare/"&gt; Fastpass System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What attractions utilize the Fastpass system&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How does traditional, free Fastpass work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= "https://tripswithtykes.com/disneyland-maxpass-questions-answered/"&gt; What is MaxPass&lt;/a&gt; and how does it work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The down side to each system&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who is Fastpass good for&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who is MaxPass good for&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Why Leslie is responsible for the increase in MaxPass... Okay we don't outright say she is responsible for the latest increase, but listen to when we talk about how much she is willing to pay... totally her fault!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? &lt;a href= "https://www.loveourcrazylife.com/disneylands-maxpass-worth-cost/"&gt;Is MaxPass worth the new, higher cost&lt;/a&gt;? Tell us below!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plan Your Disneyland Vacation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to book a Disneyland vacation we suggest &lt;a title="Get Away Today" href= "https://www.getawaytoday.com/?referrerid=7526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;booking through our partners at Get Away Today&lt;/a&gt;.

And yet, she recently ended up on safari in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia — not exactly her kind of bucket list adventure.

In a city that was forged in a crucible of earthquakes and fire, the 15-second message was a reminder to prepare for the worst — even if many residents ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2019, the city's &lt;a href="https://sfdem.org/tuesday-noon-siren"&gt;Department of Emergency Management&lt;/a&gt; announced that it was taking the system offline for two years to improve reliability and security in an overhaul that could cost as much as $2.5 million.&amp;nbsp;Now that the tradition has been interrupted, has the rhythm of city life lost a step? Also, who's likely to hear the Tuesday noon siren and what does it say about class and privilege?&lt;/p&gt;

Over a delicious curry cooked by his mum the proud Yorkshireman told me how going out to explore the world was not encouraged within the Pakistani community. But the decline in health of his dad was a wake-up call to Imran that good health is not a given, nor does it last for ever. That, combined with redundancy, spurred him into action.&lt;br&gt;Imran didn't tell his family he was going to cycle round the world, only that "I'll be gone for a few months, then I'll be back..."!&lt;br&gt;The similarities and the differences between Imran's story of cycling around the world and my own fascinated me.Going round the world, says Imran, is an education. It halts time. You learn more on a journey like that than you will in the rest of your life. A bicycle helped take Imran away from his problems, away from the challenges in the local area such as drugs and hanging around with a bad crowd. Nowadays Imran feels that all he needs in life is God, family and a bicycle...&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://livingadventurously.transistor.fm/subscribe"&gt;PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO THE LIVING ADVENTUROUSLY PODCAST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(It’s completely free, zero hassle to do (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://livingadventurously.transistor.fm/subscribe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;click here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), but really helpful for me trying to get a new podcast off the ground.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imran thinks Yorkshire is the best place in the world to live, better even than California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solitude and peace of the mosque five times a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unification of cultures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have so much on our doorstep that you don't necessarily need to go on a massive global journey to experience great places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You hear of people who have been to the other side of the world but have not experienced Cornwall or the North Coast 500 or the Lakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Britain is one of the best cultures of the world: The variety, the amalgamation of cultures and all the foods in Britain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundancy committed him to action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The decline in health of his father was a wake-up call to Imran that good health is not a given, nor does it last for ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going out to explore the world was not encouraged within the Pakistani community so this was an additional layer of 'barrier' that Imran faced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imran didn't tell his Mum he was going to cycle round the world, just "I'll be gone for a few months, then I'll be back..."!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I had the intention to cycle round the world, but I didn't believe that I would do it."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going round the world is an education. It halts time. You learn more in it than you will in the rest of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he got home everyone's attitude had changed and they were very proud of what he had done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praying is like 'hitting the reset button'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bicycle helped take Imran away from his problems, away from the bad stuff in the area such as drugs and hanging around with a bad crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God, family and a bicycle...&lt;/li&gt;

Episode 174 of The Thoughtful Travel Podcast includes chats with three travellers who've learnt some solid life lessons during their travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start off by chatting with Nicci O'Mara about a sad but important life-changing moment that happened to her in Africa a couple of decades ago. We talk about how important it is to grab life by the horns and not put off things we really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I talk with Eugene Devereux about his recent experiences exploring south-east Asia, an area very different to his homeland of Ireland. He explains that he learnt a lot of life lessons by experiencing such different cultures and coming to understand their history, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I chat with Kate Manser about a lesson she learnt about hospitality while she was travelling in remote Indonesia. We also circle back to something similar to Nicci's lesson and discuss why you should jump at any travel opportunity that is presented to you!&lt;/p&gt;

They went against the status quo and managed to build a 7-figure portfolio, which allowed them to retire in their 30s and travel the world!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the episode, Kristy and Bryce give us a better understanding of the benefits of the FIRE movement and the Nomad movement. They share their own experiences and learning while on their nomad journey.

And since that's home for me, it's a pleasure to report that they had a great time!&lt;/p&gt; Best Places in the Dordogne and Aveyron &lt;p&gt;They visited Sarlat, La Roque Gageac, Beynac, Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, Belcastel, Najac, Toulouse and Carcassone so those were busy days and well planned-out days. They have great accommodations and restaurant recommendations too!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the episode we don't talk about Toulouse and Carcassonne because we ran out of time, but check out Scott's Guest Notes for information on those.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott has been in France several times and loves lots of things about it  including food, wine, and French culture.&lt;/p&gt; Accommodations Recommendations &lt;p&gt;They like to stay in one place for 2 or 3 nights and will pick either hotel or rental depending on what the area has to offer. These are the gems they found on this trip:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11207934?source_impression_id=p3_1560303740_wxR733P%2BrsT%2FWyo%2B"&gt; Airbnb in Sarlat&lt;/a&gt; (Dordogne)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= "https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/chambre-d-39-hote-au-chateau-de-belcastel.en.html?aid=954523&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2"&gt; Chateau de Belecastel&lt;/a&gt; (Aveyron)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/plus/27352925?source_impression_id=p3_1560308192_XcfFqMMuIJ2TNXZR"&gt; Airbnb in Najac&lt;/a&gt; (Aveyron)&lt;/p&gt; Restaurant Recommendations &lt;p&gt;They only made a brief stop in Bordeaux but managed to find a great restaurant: La Tupina. This is a restaurant with a country feel and an open fire in the middle of it and they serve great local specialties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Belcastel they really enjoyed the Restaurant du Vieux Pont. It's worth making a reservation to eat at this one-star restaurant because the other food option in Belcastel is a little touristy restaurant Annie tried that was nothing to write home about!&lt;/p&gt; About Renting a Car in France &lt;p&gt;Don't let the car rental agency upgrade you to a bigger car, it won't fit anywhere! And also, don't follow Google Maps too closely. If it's taking you on a dirt road, don't go there unless you've been warned that the entrance gate is on a dirt road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You've got to hear what happened when they asked Google Maps to drive them to a parking lot in Belcastel! That starts at [34:27] And you also need to listen to that part because Belcastel is truly one of the most memorable scenic villages in France!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:%20annie@joinusinfrance.com"&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://joinusinfrance.com/audiotours/"&gt;Annie's Voicemap Paris Tours&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href= "https://www.facebook.com/joinusinfrance/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href= "https://www.pinterest.fr/France_Travel_Podcast/"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/addictedtofrance/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ParisPodcast"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;#joinusinfrance #Sarlat #sarlatfrance #SarlatlaCaneda #belcastel #travel #podcast #occitanie&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>annie@joinusinfrance.com (Join Us in France Travel Podcast)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">64eb7cae8f6d47aaadac9f5d1062c6a8</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/64eb7cae8f6d47aaadac9f5d1062c6a8/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 09:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>National Parks Traveler Podcast : National Parks Traveler Podcast</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Candy Harrington, a journalist who traveled the National Park System to see how accessible lodges and trails in the parks really are, discusses her new book on accessibility in the parks.

&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the rides at Disney Parks have tracks - steel tubes or rails that our ride cars glide (or bump) over. Some of the world-wide parks actually have some pretty amazing ride systems that do NOT have tracks. This innovation in other parks eventually led us to &lt;a href="https://earzup-podcast.com/2019/12/earzup-in-depth-11/"&gt;Rise of the Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, so we suppose it's ok that we had to wait for so long to get a truly cool trackless ride. Sorry Luigi. &lt;br /&gt;

Anthony recently appeared in the Netflix film "The Last Laugh" opposite Chevy Chase and Richard Dreyfuss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="font_8"&gt;Anthony's original songs include co-write collaborations with Victoria Shaw (No. 1 hits for Garth Brooks, Lady Antebellum) Jim Brickman (21 No. 1 Albums) Jeff Franzel (Josh Groban, Justin Timberlake, Taylor Dayne), Tom Kimmel (Linda Ronstadt, Johnny Cash, Art Garfunkel) Maria Christensen (Celine Dion, Jennifer Lopez), and Nina Ossoff and Porter Carroll Jr. (Daughtry, Patti Austin, The Temptations).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="font_8"&gt;His original pop song "The Gift Is You" - which he wrote honoring his mother's battle with breast cancer (she is now cancer-free) - is currently being used as an anthem for The Susan G. Komen Foundation. His music is featured on his upcoming solo album released in the Fall 2019 which will coincide with his concert tour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="font_8"&gt;Anthony has brought his fresh take on classic &amp; contemporary songs as well as his movie-bound original tunes across the United States and around the world to performing arts centers, theaters and private events, as well as intimate jazz clubs and symphony concerts with orchestras such as the New York Pops, Detroit Symphony, Cleveland Pops, Colorado Symphony, Lancaster Symphony, Annapolis Symphony, Plymouth Symphony, Cape Cod Symphony, Toledo Symphony, Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and more. He has performed at private events across the United States and recently in England, Spain, Italy and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="font_8"&gt;In his 2019-2020 concert tour Anthony brings his soulful and lyrical tenor voice to the greatest love songs ever written. He and his Grammy-winning musicians re-imagine “Unchained Melody,” “Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You,” “Can’t Help Falling In Love With You,” “When I Fall In Love,” “The Prayer,” “O Sole Mio,” “Somewhere,” originals including “Will You Be My Everyday?” and many more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="font_8"&gt;Anthony studied music, acting and directing at Boston College, and trained in improv comedy at the famed Upright Citizens Brigade in New York City. Featured on Good Morning America and The Rachael Ray Show, Anthony is most proud of his "ARTS MATTER!"

It’s about the time a few years ago when I drove through Iran with my brother Drew and our friends Jane and Rosi as part of an &lt;a href="http://www.teamdonundestan.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;11,000 mile road trip we took&lt;/a&gt; across Europe and Asia, raising money for charity. Along the way, we had enlightening conversations with average Iranians that made us see their country in a totally new light.&lt;/p&gt;

Note that it’s a series, so it’s best to start at the very beginning and listen to all the episodes in order for the story to make the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;

On today’s episode, Nicole Smith shares how a reunion with her best friend in Paris gave her the idea for Flytographer, a company that connects travelers with local photographers around the world, capturing special moments and experiences in a way a selfie never could. While Nicole was satisfied with her career in tech and steady life back home in Canada, she couldn’t ignore the feeling that a need for better travel photography existed and ultimately decided to take the plunge into entrepreneurship. Over the last six years, Flytographer has expanded to three-hundred cities across six continents and has been hailed one of the fastest-growing startups in Canada. Anyone who wants to make an impact on the world of travel or may have a business idea they just can’t shake, this one's for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>hello@podcastnation.org (The Trip That Changed Me)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">a78daa5c8f2c48bf8a5f8b54b4f65be8</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/a78daa5c8f2c48bf8a5f8b54b4f65be8/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 03:00:04 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Dear Bob and Sue : 03 Arches National Park: Getting Lost in the Fiery Furnace</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Would you go into a fiery furnace on purpose if you knew you’d probably get lost, have to squeeze through narrow openings, and be forced to crab walk over sketchy boulders?

Transcript of the interview&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna: M.L. Buchman is the author of over 60 romance, thriller, sci-fi, and fantasy books, as well as nonfiction. And today, we’re talking about his memoir, Mid-Life Crisis on Wheels: a Bicycle Journey Around the World. Welcome to the show, Matt.&lt;br /&gt;
Matt: Hello, and thank you. Hey, Joanna.&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna: It’s great to have you on the show. So, look, this is a hell of a book. It’s really fantastic. But I want to start at the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;
What led up to the decision to cycle around the world? What was happening in your life?&lt;br /&gt;
Matt: I tell people it’s really easy to launch on a trip like this. All you have to do is lose everything.&lt;br /&gt;
I had a business partner with a different definition of the word integrity than mine. I ended up losing not only my job and my business, but my career. And that ended up because I burned bridges from Houston to Calgary to Denver. It was astonishing what the train wreckage was.&lt;br /&gt;
I was going to lose the house. I was sitting in this house I’d spent seven years remodeling with every penny I had, and the few minutes of time. A friend said, ‘Well, if you sell the house,’ and I was like, ‘Okay, I’m going to lose the house …’&lt;br /&gt;
I started looking for the second half of that question. I was out for a walk and got nearly clipped by a cyclist, and it was like, ‘Oh, I could bicycle around the world.’&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, it made sense, because nothing else in my life did. I was single, and bummed out, and frustrated, and angry, and a workaholic that had no work. So I sold everything and got on a bicycle.&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna: I love that one. A workaholic without work. I’m a workaholic. I understand that. That’s the pressure to forget everything else.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s interesting because, on a serious note, your life was a train wreck, but you still had this house. So often it seems that we spend a lot of energy, and time, and emotional stress building things like a house, the perfect thing to have, but that’s not what really matters.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you think almost that this was going to happen, that you hadn’t really addressed what was important?&lt;br /&gt;
Matt: Yes and no. I think that what occurred was inevitable because of who I was being. Because at that time in my life, I was still under the belief that if I just try harder, it will work. If it isn’t working, try harder.&lt;br /&gt;
So I designed and built the house for the family I never had time to find.</description><author>jo@booksandtravel.page (Books And Travel)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">3ce911fef9c8416bb7e137db7018df9c</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/3ce911fef9c8416bb7e137db7018df9c/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:10:02 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Have Camper Will Travel : 5 Closet Tips For Camper Living</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When you live in 400 sq ft or less, you've got limited closet space.

Jeff is constantly traveling and developing new techniques for catching the most exotic fish imaginable in places where even the most avid adventurers are at times hesitant to go! As an active lecturer, published author, accomplished artist, IGFA World Record holder, and the subject of numerous films, articles, and media projects, Jeff is a fly fishing personality that is as entertaining and educational as he is legitimate. He is an incredibly reliable source of information and inspiration, the most senior member of the Yellow Dog Ambassador team, and a close friend. And while Jeff can boast one of the most impressive resumes around, he remains one of the most authentic and humble people in the industry – always willing to take his accomplishments one step further by passing on what he has learned. Kicking-off Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Waypoints&lt;/em&gt; is an episode that scratches the surface of a life deeply devoted to fly fishing the world: a sit-down that is packed with numerous tips and great fishing stories from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>jim@yellowdogflyfishing.com (WAYPOINTS - with Jim Klug)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">64812e9a0c2440c3a094312afd187d70</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/64812e9a0c2440c3a094312afd187d70/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 02:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Morocco : Why Morocco 030 – Lonely Planet travel writer Helen Ranger on Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains</title><description>&lt;p&gt;For the thirtieth episode of Why Morocco, I reached Lonely Planet travel writer Helen Ranger by telephone from my studio in Marrakech. Helen is a friend and colleague, concierge, a fellow Morocco lover albeit one who prefers to call Fez home, and has recently submitted a chapter about Morocco&amp;#8217;s rural Middle Atlas Mountain region for the forthcoming Lonely Planet Morocco guidebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our chat, Helen talks about two of the national parks in the region, trekking options, the Sidi Harazem baths, caves, and what you’ll want to know for planning a Middle Atlas getaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearby waterfalls and caves, nature reserves, a brutalistis thermal bath complex, village markets, and festivals to enjoy, I don’t really understand why more people don’t take advantage of a short-haul long weekend in the Fez countryside. And with all the tips that Helen provides for planning a trip to the rural Middle Atlas region, Fez could double as a base for exploring the old city and a getaway in the countryside. After all, the city is served with international flights to leading European destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

Main Topic
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main topic this month is one of the recently closed classics, The Disney-MGM Studios Backlot Tour. There have been so many changes and updates over the years, but we are going to focus on the original, for the most part. How is our guide on this episode, walking us through the entire tram portion of the tour. We take it right back to 1989, going through how the Disney-MGM Studios actually worked. The concept of going past the theme park and then entering the studio - this is how the tour basically began. The walking tour was part of this, but we are not going to discuss this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlot tour had so many different aspects including residential street, the boneyard, the various production trailers, and so many other little nuggets. The tour seemed to change often, as far as props and items but the tour wasn't complete with a look at the Streets of America, or the New York street set. You would know this as the set for "The Lottery", which seems to be the only movie filmed here that we ever hear about. To accompany this episode, we have a great video on our YouTube channel - &lt;a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_DX0WnRHs8&amp;feature=youtu.be'&gt;click here to watch&lt;/a&gt; after the episode!&lt;/p&gt;
