&lt;p&gt;Good friend of the show, Jon from England, joins us in our latest Episode to discuss their first sailing on the Disney Fantasy.  This was also the first time he and his family had sailed to the Caribbean.  We have a good time discussing all the fun they had onboard the Fantasy, and some of the differences between the Dream Class vs. Classic ships.  We finish up with a look at the amazing ports they stopped at, St. Kitts, Antigua, San Juan Puerto Rico, and of course Castaway Cay.  Enjoy everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

In her book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674980484/?tag=newbooinhis-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Colonial Politics of Global Health: France and the United Nations in Postwar Africa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Harvard University Press, 2018), &lt;a href="https://www.macalester.edu/history/facultystaff/jessicapearsonpatel/"&gt;Jessica Lynne Pearson&lt;/a&gt; steers clear of these obstacles and tells a captivating and consequential story about the relationship between global governance and empires. And that is no small feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Colonial Politics of Global Health&lt;/em&gt; recounts France’s collision with the UN and World Health Organization in the immediate post-World War II years. She shows how French colonial administrators and doctors resisted organizations devoted to “global health,” fearing that they would would ramp up anticolonialism and eventually help detach colonial territories from the metropole. She also shows how that resistance has left legacies that continue to affect Sub-Saharan Africa to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book should interest historians of empire, health and medicine, and global governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.history.northwestern.edu/people/graduate-students/dexter-fergie.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dexter Fergie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a PhD student of US and global history at Northwestern University.

Here, amid the craftsmen and specialists who made tombs, a man named Kha and a woman named Merit enjoyed an affluent lifestyle. When they died, they were interred with all their worldly possessions and slept undisturbed for 3300 years. Then, a wonderful discovery occurred and an ancient story came to life...

She had a well-paid dream job in Australia, lived in a beautiful place and felt secure in the knowledge that this could go on, indefinitely. But she was, she realised, unfulfilled. She was not, it turned out, truly happy with this life at all.By chance Sophie came across a reference to Nancy Kline’s book Time to Think. She described a way of being with one another that is both incredibly simple, and incredibly rare. We don’t give ourselves, or others, the freedom to think without interruption, or judgment, or time limits, or an obsession with outcomes. We limit our thinking, our conversations, our relationships and our entire lives by confining our minds.Sophie began to question the life she had chosen. She began to ask what she really wanted, to explore the ‘authentic’ me, her instinctive mind, and gradually, she began to reclaim what really mattered. Sophie left corporate life, moved back to the UK, and met the man who is now her husband and father to her two children.We need to reclaim time to think in our life if we are to do meaningful things with our life.I was struck by how deeply Sophie listened and quickly figured me out. It was almost bizarre, in a nice way. I asked her how I could become a better listener, and how to ask better questions - both pretty crucial things for a novice podcaster to get to grips with...&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://livingadventurously.transistor.fm/subscribe"&gt;PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO THE LIVING ADVENTUROUSLY PODCAST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;(It’s completely &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;zero hassle&lt;/strong&gt; to do (&lt;a href="https://livingadventurously.transistor.fm/subscribe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;click here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), but really &lt;strong&gt;helpful&lt;/strong&gt; for me trying to get a new podcast off the ground.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to reclaim time to think in our life if we are to do meaningful things with our life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't just fill the time with nothing: it needs to be a bit more conscious and structured than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruminative thinking - we just go over and over the same thoughts time and again (often negative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our brains try to keep us safe by just thinking the same stuff over and over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking with someone else rather than ourselves helps keep it focussed rather than distracted. Having someone listen to us makes it easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually we come up with lists of all the things we don't want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First big question: "what do you really want?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We jump to assumptions that stop us doing what we want to do, largely without evidence, largely unexamined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At root there are a couple of major assumptions that stop us: a sense of worthiness, belonging and being enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all have a need for safety, connection and autonomy, but they manifest in different ways for each of us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking is like a seed - it needs the right conditions to thrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consciously choose what it is that you want and do not want in life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to warm up to thinking well and more deeply. Ask "so what?" to your answers lots of times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a better listener starts with talking less, and choosing to become a better listener. Stop interrupting. Get really interested in other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get interested in other people. Not necessarily in the subject they are interested in, but in the fact that they are interested in that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To ask better questions, think about what is the purpose of your question?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best questions are ones that you do not know the answer to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask either very broad or very specific questions. For example, "what do you want to think about?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her decision-making has changed. It used to be about challenge and proving what a well-lived life entailed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often we lead the life that we think we Should live, rather than the life of our choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your motivations from being fear-based to doing things that you love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When making a big change some people leap into the unknown, others establish some breathing space and time and security to cushion the leap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't have to make enormous changes and drastic switches - it can be small steps that are transformative and life-changing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experiences when we are vulnerable are often those that transform our lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relationship between vulnerability and trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate, drink lots of water, and remove social media from the phone - all simple but not easy and beneficial things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;TRANSCRIPT&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below is the transcription of our conversation. It’s done by AI so is perhaps a wee bit ropey here and there. If these transcripts prove sufficiently useful then I will make the effort to clean then up and make them better. Do let me know if you think it’s worth my time to do that.

Travel has changed a LOT in that decade - more than I realised, until I started thinking more deeply about it and asking what some of my favourite thoughtful travellers thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Episode 170 of The Thoughtful Travel Podcast, I talk about many of the ways in which how we travel, why we travel, what we do when we travel, and more, has changed since 2010. A shout out to my lovely friend Kristy Morton, first, for giving me the idea for this episode - fitting, since she was the very first guest I ever interviewed! In this episode, you'll hear a fabulous variety of ideas and opinions from my fellow travel media from the Australian Society of Travel Writers and, just because I realised I needed diversity (it was an all-female show until then!) a snippet from my friend Ian, aka The Barefoot Backpacker, from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics traverse a wide range: of course, the incredible developments in smartphone technology rate highly, but there is also discussion of how the #metoo movement has changed travel, how industry disruptors like Airbnb have altered how many of us travel, and, most excitingly for me, how many travellers are maturing in what they want: the rise of niche travel and, I hope, the rise of thoughtful travel!&lt;/p&gt;

#1- When Gringos commit crimes against other Gringos:
You’d be surprised how often it happens, especially when on the gringo tourist trail, and today we have all the dope  
 
#2- Do Latinos feel the same about their day jobs as gringos do?
Polls say 27% of gringos hate their jobs and 67% tune out and just go through the motions like zombies. Its called “sleepworking”. Is it similar with working Latinos too? You’ll be surprised…
 
#3- What you didn’t know about Latin American Factories and Sweatshops:
 
#4- Latinos working “on the books” don’t make much dough, but they do get TWO extra monthly salaries a year:
It’s one of the odd things you have to plan for if you have Latino employees, but that’s not all…there’s more..  
 
#5- Should you put your Latino or Latina employees “on the books” and register them with the government or is it better to just pay them in cash?

The source of the melody was unknown to some.  But to others, it brought the promise of freedom and the protection of one pledged to shelter them.

Still today, many claim to hear this music.  Unsuspecting hikers and passersby also report seeing a shining green light, resembling a handheld lantern.  Both emanate from a historic cemetery situated on the northern bank of the Ohio River.    

Come hear the Legend of the Fiddler’s Green.  It’s the tale of one Henry Darby, a 19th century man of high standing in the Cincinnati community.  He was a rumored clandestine supporter of runaway slaves.  His reputation is still debated today.  Is it true?  Did he guide freedom-seekers across the Ohio River with his music?

Come decide for yourself.

Transcript of the interview&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna Penn: SJI Holliday is a scientist, writing coach, and the bestselling author of five crime novels, including the Bankstoun trilogy set in a fictional town in Scotland. Susi was born and raised in Scotland, but today we’re talking about her novel Violet, which is set on the Trans-Siberian Express Railway.&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome Susi.&lt;br /&gt;
Susi Holliday: Hello. Thanks for having me.&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna Penn: It’s great to have you on the show. I think the Trans-Siberian Express has this romance about it. Now, you went on the railway in 2006 so take us back to that time.&lt;br /&gt;
Why did you decide to take that trip?&lt;br /&gt;
Susi Holliday: Well, it was actually part of a much bigger trip and it came from actually something that happened in 2005, which was the London bombings.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened was that weekend, my husband and I were supposed to go to a gig, and it was canceled because of this. And it just made us both think about what we were doing. We were both working full time and we were just living a normal life.&lt;br /&gt;
And we felt, you know what? We should go off and do some traveling because you never know what’s going to happen to you. So we basically spent about five months planning a trip and we then left in January 2006 and went on a six month round the world trip. There were lots of different places. We traveled on lots of different modes of transport. And one of those was the Trans-Siberian.&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna Penn: Wow. That is a big thing. So you weren’t actually in the London bombings?&lt;br /&gt;
Susi Holliday: We were just there and then my sisters were coming down to visit me that weekend and they got turned away. Their train got turned away on the way down. It was stopped and they were taken back. My brother was running around on his scooter and going to Kings Cross and things like that all day.&lt;br /&gt;
And it just made me think that anything could have happened. I was lucky that nothing did happen to me or anyone close to me, but it just gave me a bit of a jolt about life and made me think I want to do something. And so travel was the thing.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>jo@booksandtravel.page (Books And Travel)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">d4be6e41dbcc4d48aa277cb22cea70b6</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/d4be6e41dbcc4d48aa277cb22cea70b6/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 02:10:37 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>The Biscuit CLT Podcast : CMCLT Rewind: Manny and Adrienne Threatt</title><description>&lt;p&gt;At the first Creative Mornings Charlotte of the new decade, Manny and Adrienne Threatt of Hope Vibes delivered a stirring presentation in the hall of Myers Park Presbyterian Church. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're not familiar with Hope Vibes, they're a non-profit organization here in Charlotte that provides basic services to our homeless population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hosts Tim Miner and Matt Olin talk to Manny and Adrienne about how their upbringing spurred them into action, The Hope Tank (their mobile shower and hygiene station), and what it means to lead the next generation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stick around through the end as producer Andy Goh asks Creative Mornings attendees what their creative New Year's resolutions for Charlotte are.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>tim@charlotteiscreative.com (The Biscuit CLT Podcast)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">df59955184fb4253ad7c3ca7fefabb55</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/df59955184fb4253ad7c3ca7fefabb55/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 21:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>San Francisco Real Estate: Escrow Out Loud : To Stage, Or Not to Stage</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s episode of &lt;a href="https://jacksonfuller.com/insight/podcast/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Escrow Out Loud, our San Francisco Real Estate podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; we have a very special guest star: our friend and client Kay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[00:44] Kay shares a little of her background with us. We also learn how she came to buy her lovely house in Burlingame almost forty years ago which was almost brand new at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[03:46] Other than the perfect location, the two other features that made Kay fall in love with the house were the easy upkeep and the huge closets!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[05:24] This summer we accidentally found her second dream home, so we needed to get Kay’s home in Burlingame on the market fast. Kay explains it was a challenge of getting her home ready for sale while still living in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[07:14] Initially, we tried to sell Kay’s house as is, with all her furniture but didn't have much luck. We then moved Kay out, revamped and staged the house before trying again. What was the second process like in comparison to the first time around?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[09:29] The unique thing about selling a house is the emotional component that comes with it. After all the renovations Kay’s home was completely transformed. Did it hurt her feelings having to do this or was it exciting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[14:30] The house was put on the market the second time and this time it sold within ten days, over asking price. Looking back on all of the drama, was it all worth it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[15:09] Interestingly, after looking at numerous properties, the new house Kay ended up buying was also staged. What advice does she have for anyone considering selling their place while still living in it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[16:46] While selling a home is a very emotional process, the aim is to make as much money as possible. To achieve this, it needs to look as good as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening.
