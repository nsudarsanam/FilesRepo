Pinterest, and HGTV, design has become a cultural obsession, and this is having a big impact on travel and hospitality. Adam Farmerie, one of the four principals at award-winning design firm AvroKO, is responsible for many of the hotels, private clubs, bars, and restaurants that are topping our must-see travel lists. He talks about how and why he designs these provocative spaces.

Besteman&lt;/a&gt;'s book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822360446/?tag=newbooinhis-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making Refuge: Somali Bantu Refugees and Lewiston, Main&lt;/em&gt;e&lt;/a&gt; (Duke University Press, 2016) is an important contribution to our understanding of the process of remaking one’s way of life after war in a new place, and in a new culture. Besteman writes about her ethnographic encounter in the 1980s with Somalis from the village of Banta who she then re-encounters in 2006 in the town of Lewiston, the so-called “Armpit of Maine.” The result is an intimate account of the trajectory of Somali Bantus from their home in the Jubba Valley, their experience flight to refugee camps in neighboring Kenya and their eventual relocation to cities and towns in the United States. Readers also learn that assimilation is not just a one-sided affair, as Besteman narrates how the arrival of Somali Bantus in Lewiston impacts residents there, neighbors and government officials alike. As such, &lt;em&gt;Making Refuge&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that resettlement is more than the arrival of refugees; it is also a process by which receiving communities adapt to their foreign neighbors. In other words, Besteman’s work is a study of mutual transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.colgate.edu/about/directory/sthomson"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Susan Thomson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is associate professor of peace and conflict studies at Colgate University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

He has published extensively in academic journals, and has released a number of books on UK wildlife and the environment. Ian is a man positively bursting with enthusiasm and knowledge and ideas.Ian poured forth a cheerful stream of lessons on the environment, eco-tourism and rewilding. &lt;br&gt;We talked about the cultural severance between cities and wildness, and the reassuring dictum that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; change the world, a little bit at a time: perhaps by beginning with rewilding your back garden.&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://livingadventurously.transistor.fm/subscribe"&gt;PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO THE LIVING ADVENTUROUSLY PODCAST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(It’s completely free, zero hassle to do (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://livingadventurously.transistor.fm/subscribe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;click here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), but really helpful for me trying to get a new podcast off the ground.

&lt;li&gt;Ecotourism should not only be "take only photographs, leave only footprints", but we also need to try to help people in a benign way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adventure literature is often about "defeating nature" rather than pausing for a while or caring for the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need more respect and awareness when dealing with the vulnerable resource of the natural world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How best to minimise your damage and maximise your positive impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/"&gt;Rewilding&lt;/a&gt;, in all its guises, (including rewilding the mind) can save the NHS millions, as well as all the other benefits.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The communities that are able to protest about their environment are usually the most affluent ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trees give you a sense of place and seasonality. They are therapeutic and spiritually uplifting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new urban wild and bringing wild to the people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultural severance in urban landscapes - a broken connection between cities and wildness&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You can change the world, even incrementally and a bit at a time. Rewilding your garden is a good start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Globally and in Britain, in terms of nature conservation, biodiversity and sustainability we are indeed in a very bad way – essentially the ecosystem is broken and we need to mend it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problems are not as simple as carbon = climate change = plant lots of trees! Such naïve thinking is actually dangerously misconceived&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewilding offers a radical new approach to resolving many of the issues in ways which are, paraphrased from Lawton (2010), bigger, bolder, better, more joined …..However, this idea needs to connect with a far wider community especially in urban areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, approaches have to be paid for and not just with ‘ecosystem services which are community goods’ – but with MONEY ….. (This is a fact not popular with politicians for example!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suggest that farmers &amp;amp; farming have to be part of the SOLUTION and are not, as often portrayed, the problem&lt;/li&gt;

In Episode 171 of The Thoughtful Travel Podcast I'm chatting with three guests who've made the big move: one to Mexico, one to Japan, and one from Brazil to Australia. We've got half the world covered!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, I talk with Queen D Michele who retired from her job as a school teacher in the United States and moved to Mexico. I asked her what her family and friends thought about her big move which opened up one of the most amazing stories of all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I chat to Suzanne Kamata who is an American married to a Japanese man and living in a fairly rural part of Japan. It's interesting for me to hear how she feels there after several decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Luana Marchi explains about the decision she and her husband made to leave their home country of Brazil and migrate to Australia - though at the start, they weren't so sure of their lifelong plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good friend of the show, Jon from England, joins us in our latest Episode to discuss their first sailing on the Disney Fantasy.  This was also the first time he and his family had sailed to the Caribbean.  We have a good time discussing all the fun they had onboard the Fantasy, and some of the differences between the Dream Class vs. Classic ships.  We finish up with a look at the amazing ports they stopped at, St. Kitts, Antigua, San Juan Puerto Rico, and of course Castaway Cay.  Enjoy everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

#1- When Gringos commit crimes against other Gringos:
You’d be surprised how often it happens, especially when on the gringo tourist trail, and today we have all the dope  
 
#2- Do Latinos feel the same about their day jobs as gringos do?
Polls say 27% of gringos hate their jobs and 67% tune out and just go through the motions like zombies. Its called “sleepworking”. Is it similar with working Latinos too? You’ll be surprised…
 
#3- What you didn’t know about Latin American Factories and Sweatshops:
 
#4- Latinos working “on the books” don’t make much dough, but they do get TWO extra monthly salaries a year:
It’s one of the odd things you have to plan for if you have Latino employees, but that’s not all…there’s more..  
 
#5- Should you put your Latino or Latina employees “on the books” and register them with the government or is it better to just pay them in cash?  
 
 #6- Be sure to pick up my "LATIN AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REPORT":
It's been completely revised for 2020 (and beyond) including the latest "Stem Cell" info and data and my top picks for the best treatment centers for expats and gringos.

The source of the melody was unknown to some.  But to others, it brought the promise of freedom and the protection of one pledged to shelter them.

Still today, many claim to hear this music.  Unsuspecting hikers and passersby also report seeing a shining green light, resembling a handheld lantern.  Both emanate from a historic cemetery situated on the northern bank of the Ohio River.    

Come hear the Legend of the Fiddler’s Green.  It’s the tale of one Henry Darby, a 19th century man of high standing in the Cincinnati community.  He was a rumored clandestine supporter of runaway slaves.  His reputation is still debated today.  Is it true?  Did he guide freedom-seekers across the Ohio River with his music?

Come decide for yourself.

Transcript of the interview&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna Penn: SJI Holliday is a scientist, writing coach, and the bestselling author of five crime novels, including the Bankstoun trilogy set in a fictional town in Scotland. Susi was born and raised in Scotland, but today we’re talking about her novel Violet, which is set on the Trans-Siberian Express Railway.&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome Susi.&lt;br /&gt;
Susi Holliday: Hello. Thanks for having me.&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna Penn: It’s great to have you on the show. I think the Trans-Siberian Express has this romance about it. Now, you went on the railway in 2006 so take us back to that time.&lt;br /&gt;
Why did you decide to take that trip?&lt;br /&gt;
Susi Holliday: Well, it was actually part of a much bigger trip and it came from actually something that happened in 2005, which was the London bombings.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened was that weekend, my husband and I were supposed to go to a gig, and it was canceled because of this. And it just made us both think about what we were doing. We were both working full time and we were just living a normal life.&lt;br /&gt;
And we felt, you know what? We should go off and do some traveling because you never know what’s going to happen to you. So we basically spent about five months planning a trip and we then left in January 2006 and went on a six month round the world trip. There were lots of different places. We traveled on lots of different modes of transport. And one of those was the Trans-Siberian.&lt;br /&gt;
Joanna Penn: Wow. That is a big thing. So you weren’t actually in the London bombings?&lt;br /&gt;
Susi Holliday: We were just there and then my sisters were coming down to visit me that weekend and they got turned away. Their train got turned away on the way down. It was stopped and they were taken back. My brother was running around on his scooter and going to Kings Cross and things like that all day.&lt;br /&gt;
And it just made me think that anything could have happened. I was lucky that nothing did happen to me or anyone close to me, but it just gave me a bit of a jolt about life and made me think I want to do something. And so travel was the thing.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>jo@booksandtravel.page (Books And Travel)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">d4be6e41dbcc4d48aa277cb22cea70b6</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/d4be6e41dbcc4d48aa277cb22cea70b6/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 02:10:37 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>The Biscuit CLT Podcast : CMCLT Rewind: Manny and Adrienne Threatt</title><description>&lt;p&gt;At the first Creative Mornings Charlotte of the new decade, Manny and Adrienne Threatt of Hope Vibes delivered a stirring presentation in the hall of Myers Park Presbyterian Church. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're not familiar with Hope Vibes, they're a non-profit organization here in Charlotte that provides basic services to our homeless population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hosts Tim Miner and Matt Olin talk to Manny and Adrienne about how their upbringing spurred them into action, The Hope Tank (their mobile shower and hygiene station), and what it means to lead the next generation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stick around through the end as producer Andy Goh asks Creative Mornings attendees what their creative New Year's resolutions for Charlotte are.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>tim@charlotteiscreative.com (The Biscuit CLT Podcast)</author><guid isPermaLink="false">df59955184fb4253ad7c3ca7fefabb55</guid><enclosure url="https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/df59955184fb4253ad7c3ca7fefabb55/" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 21:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>San Francisco Real Estate: Escrow Out Loud : To Stage, Or Not to Stage</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s episode of &lt;a href="https://jacksonfuller.com/insight/podcast/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Escrow Out Loud, our San Francisco Real Estate podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; we have a very special guest star: our friend and client Kay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[00:44] Kay shares a little of her background with us. We also learn how she came to buy her lovely house in Burlingame almost forty years ago which was almost brand new at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[03:46] Other than the perfect location, the two other features that made Kay fall in love with the house were the easy upkeep and the huge closets!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[05:24] This summer we accidentally found her second dream home, so we needed to get Kay’s home in Burlingame on the market fast. Kay explains it was a challenge of getting her home ready for sale while still living in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[07:14] Initially, we tried to sell Kay’s house as is, with all her furniture but didn't have much luck. We then moved Kay out, revamped and staged the house before trying again. What was the second process like in comparison to the first time around?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[09:29] The unique thing about selling a house is the emotional component that comes with it. After all the renovations Kay’s home was completely transformed. Did it hurt her feelings having to do this or was it exciting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[14:30] The house was put on the market the second time and this time it sold within ten days, over asking price. Looking back on all of the drama, was it all worth it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;[15:09] Interestingly, after looking at numerous properties, the new house Kay ended up buying was also staged.
